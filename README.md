Note that the Code is far from efficient or perfect. The idea was to have a reusable implementation. 

* The folder iivestimatoR contains the R-Package with functions that implement what is seen in the Paper.
* the example_implementation.Rmd file contains a mark-down file that implements the iiv identification with the widely available card dataset with distance to college as imperfect instrument.
